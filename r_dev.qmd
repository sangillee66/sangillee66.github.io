## R Shiny Web Applications

### Spatial Kernel Density Estimation

-   This application is designed to let users to create their own spatial kernel density estimation maps, sometimes called heat maps, on the internet.
-   It utilizes an R package, [`SpatialKDE`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SpatialKDE/vignettes/SpatialKDE.html), which is based on [QGIS Heatmap tool](https://grindgis.com/software/heat-map-using-qgis).

## R Packages

### `salsa`

-   `salsa` stands for [S]{.underline} [a]{.underline}nd [L]{.underline} for [s]{.underline}patial [a]{.underline}utocorrelation. This is basically an R implementation of *S* and *L* statistics developed by me [@lee2001; @lee2004; @lee2009a].
-   It also includes other functions associated with spatial autocorrelation.
-   It will be uploaded in two weeks.
